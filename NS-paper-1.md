<p align="center"><b>Strategic Cyber Policy Recommendations Report for Congress</b></p>

<b>Introduction</b>. The United States is at a critical juncture with relation to the cyber domain and national security. Technological use in US citizen's daily lives is ever increasing, competitors such as Russia and China are shrinking the technology gap and reducing the United State's military advantage, and both AI and quantum computing development will have a significant impact on National Security. Congress must act within its powers to maintain the United State's technological advantage as well as pass laws that protect US citizens, businesses, and military. 

Shrinking Technological Advantage. The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (AI) notes that the US is under threat of losing its military-technical advantage within the next decade, unless accelerated adoption of AI occurs [1]. Furthermore, both Russia and China are regularly conducting attacks on US satellites with non-kinetic means such as radio jamming and cyber attacks [21]. As Congress holds the power of the budget, it is within their power to support and create programs that will prevent the decline of the US technological advantage. 

Quantum computing is area of significant interest to national security due to the possible computing power. While small scale quantum computers have been created [19], there is yet to be a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC). A CRQC would be able to break widely deployed public key algorithms that are used in today's National Security Systems [19]. Currently, China is the top competitor to the United States in the area of quantum computing [7]. The United States should consider two strategic goals regarding quantum computing. First and foremost, develop quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. The NSA notes that new cryptography can take over 20 years to develop [19]. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has already created a Post-Quantum Cryptography project [5], and Congress should continue to invest in this program. Second, the United States needs to have the capability to build its own CRQC as this will provide a significant strategic advantage over nation states that do not have this ability. 

Software acquisition and development within the federal government has failed to keep up with the commercial sector [27]. The ability to quickly integrate and adapt software is critical to national security. In the commercial world, DevOps emphasizes communication, collaboration and continuous integration between developers and users [17]. The Department of Defense (DoD) has recently started programs for DevSecOps, which is an iterative software development model that incorporates development, security, and operations as key elements in delivering useful capability to the users of the software [17]. The DoD has also recently released an Agile Software Acquisition Guidebook containing lessons learned from two pilot programs [17]. Congress should take both Agile acquisition and DevSecOps as base models and look to stand up programs outside of the DoD for other federal departments. The GAO report also noted that over half of weapon systems and nearly all major business IT programs reviewed reported staffing challenges for software development, particularly hiring staff for their programs [17]. 

In order to be able to recruit the talent necessary for maintaining our technological advantage, multiple avenues should be considered. Existing programs, such as the Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which was created under the Federal Cyber Service Training and Education Initiative [23] should continue to be invested in as an avenue to recruit a new generation of cyber professionals. While these types of programs are beneficial for traditional recruitment and retention, they do not necessarily resonate with a significant pool of talent- the hacking community.

The hacking community in general tends to have different norms and values compared to traditional public servants. For example, members of L0pht in the early hacking community had a variety of opinions on illegal activity in the pursuit of knowledge [14]. Another difference can be seen in the Hacker Manifesto, published in 1986 by the Mentor, where in his view his only crime is being curious [30]. The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has proposed creating a new pipeline for digital talent that includes a US Digital Service Academy and a Digital Corps [1]. This new academy should take into consideration the social differences between the hacking community and traditional federal servants, striving to bridge the cultural differences between the two. Of particular interest would be designing a system that does not have the traditional leadership structure of the military, as the hacking community tends to be fairly anti-authority.

This new Digital Corps should consider a new type of security clearance designed specifically for members of the hacking community. During the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, there have been members of the hacking community that have desired to serve their country yet have not been able to pass the traditional security clearance process, instead working through contractors or sub-contractors [14]. A new clearance for the Digital Corps may be able to consider social factors unique to the hacking community when examining prior trouble with the law. This may potentially increase recruitment and retention from a highly skilled talent pool.

<b>Priority Actions - Maintain Technological Advantage</b>
- Bolster existing cyber security pipelines
- Develop a new Digital Service Academy
- Create a Digital Corps
- Focus on AI and Quantum Computing
- Improve software acquisition and development processes

<b>Shifting Power Dynamics</b>. The rise in technology has resulted in a significant change in the power dynamics between nation states and individuals. Individuals now have the capacity to attack a nation state with a low probability of apprehension, low cost of developing and deploying the attack, higher than average probability of success, and orders of magnitude greater potential damage to the target [12]. Furthermore, Kilger hypothesizes that the next lifecycle phase between nation states and non-state actors may result in the advent of cyber terror organizations [12]. 

Further research into Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) should include a social aspect of the relationship between these groups and the hosting nation states. It may be possible to influence these groups to dissolve the relationship, reaching the fourth lifecycle stage proposed by Kilger. Kilger suggests that a variety of reasons may contribute to dissolution of the relationship. Public disclosure of covert relationships between these groups and the host nation's intelligence services, replacement by more skilled actors, pressure from other government entities, or if the group has acquired enough resources to become self-sufficient [12]. Leveraging these factors may result in APTs that currently work for rival nation states to change from targeting the United States to their respective host countries. This will likely require significant coordination and cooperation between many federal departments.

Another concern for national security is the possibility of non-state groups targeting hybrid military technology in politically tense regions. Both India and Pakistan are nuclear armed countries that incorporated smart weapons into their military [20, 24]. Individuals and non-state actors may have the capability to conduct cyber attacks against such weapons, potentially destabilizing a region with two hostile, nuclear armed governments. Other areas of geopolitical concern exist, China and Taiwan, and Russia and the Balkans for example. 

One way to address the threat of these ATPs is to increase the cost to perform such attacks. The acquisition or development of new cyber security defenses should carefully consider the product's role within a saturated market. Sounil Yu's Cyber Defense Matrix can be a valuable tool to guide the acquisition and development of these tools [3]. The MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) framework can be used to identify ATP's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). These TTPs are difficult and expensive for ATPs to change [10, 25]. By combining both the Cyber Defense Matrix and the ATT&CK framework, the cost of an attack for these APTs can greatly increase.

<b>Priority Actions- Shifting Power Dynamics</b>
- Focus on geopolitical stability in regions with smart weapons that may be targeted by non-state groups
- Continue to identify TTPs of ATPs 
- Smart acquisition and development of cyber security tools

<b>Disinformation and Hybrid Warfare</b>. One of the most significant threats in the past decade has been the use of disinformation combined with conventional warfare. The Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 was the first example where disinformation campaigns were combined with kinetic warfare. 

The Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) engaged in a significant disinformation campaign to influence the United States 2016 presidential election [15] and has continued its campaign to undermine faith in our democratic process and sow discord. According to the Global State of Democracy Report 2021, the United States is undergoing 'democratic backsliding' for the first time in its history  [8], suggesting that the IRA and other disinformation campaigns are currently successful in their operations. It is imperative that the United States focuses on ways to combat disinformation campaigns, particularly since other major rivals such as China and Iran are beginning to hone their own disinformation campaigns [2].

Social media companies such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Tumblr, and Instagram have all be utilized by the IRA to conduct these types of disinformation campaigns [Characterization and Comparison]. Disinformation campaigns use a variety of methods to build their audience, with more sophisticated campaigns such as those launched by the IRA taking the time to gain rapport and influence within sub-communities [2, 6]. Younger disinformation campaigns, such as the Chinese, tend to take a less sophisticated approach such as buying accounts and not taking the time to embed within sub-communities [2]. 

It is vital that the United States be able to identify and combat such disinformation campaigns. This requires cooperation from the social media platforms to gather the necessary information to identify techniques being utilized, such as purchasing of followers, follower fishing, and narrative switching [6]. Furthermore, the current trajectory of the social media platforms sets the United States up for failure as only the social media platforms will be in the position to routinely detect bad actors [6]. Congress has the authority to create laws that change this trajectory, allowing the IC and LE to work with these platforms to identify bad actors. Frameworks currently exist, specifically designed to identify adversarial misinformation and influence tactics and techniques, such as AM!TT [4]. 

Federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) are vital to national security. MITRE is a FFRDC that designed the ATT&CK framework, which may be used for adversary emulation, red teaming, behavioral analytics development, defensive gap assessment, security operations center maturity assessment, and cyber threat intelligence enrichment [29]. AM!TT Navigator was built on top of the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator, specifically tailored to disinformation and misinformation campaigns [4]. Congress should consider either incorporating the existing AM!TT framework into an existing FFRDC or creating a new program within an existing FFRDC that focuses specifically on disinformation and misinformation campaigns. 

<b>Priority Actions- Disinformation and Hybrid Warfare</b>
- Create legislation to allow the IC and LE to work with social media platforms to identify bad actors
- FFRDC program for dis/mis-information framework

<b>Federal Regulation and Laws</b>. The threat from cybercrime continues to increase. This may be in part to the publicized success of high-profile attacks such as the Colonial Pipeline attack, along with the rise of decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or those with increased focus on true anonymity such as Monero. The Identity Theft Resource Center's third quarter report for 2021 notes that the number of data breaches in 2021 has already surpassed the total for 2020 [28]. The report also notes that one state has not posted any data breach notices since September 2020 [28]. While all 50 states have laws requiring businesses to notify individuals when a breach occurs [9], there are significant discrepancies between them. There is currently no federal data breach notification law. Congress should examine the current state data breach laws and then pass a federal data breach notification law drawing from the laws that will help US citizens the most. For example, California's CCPA and CPRA require disclosure to any breach to a state resident if Personally Identifiable Information (PII) was disclosed or reasonably believed to be compromised [26]. Delaware Title 6 §12B-102 requires that breaches involving more than 500 residents notify the state Attorney General [13]. Alaska Stat. § 45.48.010 et seq requires that government agencies pay $500 per resident that is not notified by a breach [22]. By providing a federal data breach law, Congress can influence businesses to improve their cyber security under threat of financial penalties. 

Another area of concern is the use of biometric data and facial recognition. China has demonstrated that such data may be used to commit atrocities against their own population by profiling Uyghur individuals [16, 18]. Systems such as these may be misused and may be a target for cyber operations by our rivals seeking to corrupt these systems or to gain information on US citizens. Many states and local governments have created laws to protect their residents against the threat of this technology [11] and Congress should consider passing a law banning the use of such systems. 

<b>Priority Actions - Federal Regulation and Laws</b>
- Create a federal data breach law
- Examine the need for facial recognition/biometric data laws 

<b>Conclusion</b>. The United States is at a critical point when it comes to the cyber domain and significant change is required to maintain our place as a world power. For the first time in history, individuals have the ability to effectively attack a nation state. Both AI and quantum computing pose significant threats to our national security, with rival nation states such as China significantly increasing spending in these areas in an effort to win the technological race. In order for the United States to win, a new pipeline needs to be created for these types of professionals. This new pipeline should seek to include both private industry professionals and members of the hacking community, aiming to create a system that includes consideration of the social differences between the groups to increase recruitment and retention. 

The United States should also strive to increase the cost of cyber attacks against us. Frameworks like MITRE's ATT&CK and CogSec's AM!TT provide significant value to defenders while forcing APTs to take significant time and expense to change their TTPs or risk being detected. The Cyber Defense Matrix can be used to vet future cyber security tools, while the Agile acquisition/development model can be used to quickly integrate and keep current existing systems.

Lastly, Congress should examine current state laws regarding the cyber domain. The top areas with a potential to impact nation security are data breach and facial recognition/biometric data laws. Additionally, Congress should work with social media platforms to come up with a solution for detecting bad actors that does not limit this ability to the social media platforms themselves.
