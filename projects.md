# AI Projects
## [Chess AI (MinMax vs Random)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jq7Ur6EGqN6bNQ9ytXGtnf4FSGfIpwPD)
This program consists of two algorithms for selecting chess moves. The first algorithm randomly selects a valid move, while the second uses MinMax.

## [Stochastic Gradient Descent & ID3 Decision Tree](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Lmte5chcUrgygus6gbrhUu-Oag7Sv7g7?usp=sharing)
This project compares two different binary classification models (SGD and ID3 DT).

## [Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Networks](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_3ZlE0ayoA8yNihjkYcQNT_eEnIb_zV-?usp=sharing)
This project uses a CNN to evaluate the CIFAR-100 dataset (object/Image classification) and a RNN for Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the Reuters newswire classification dataset.

## [Graphs: Uninformed vs Informed Search](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MpsRwayXhSvUhW9MVJX8YctMEGxyIkmb?usp=sharing)
This project compares Bredth First Search (uninformed) to A* (informed/heuristic).

# Network Projects
## [TCP Flow Control in a Modified Web Client](https://github.com/tfrank0651/BasicWebClient)
This program is a basic web client that is modified to demonstrate TCP flow control.

## [Custom Ping Using ICMP](https://github.com/tfrank0651/CustomPing)
This program demonstrates a custom 'ping' using the ICMP protocol.

# Other Projects
## [Wordlist Creation](https://github.com/tfrank0651/Wordlist_Creation)
This is a collection of various tools I have written to create wordlists.
- numlist.py: creates all possible numeric permutations of the specified length
- hex_keys.py: creates all possible 64 bit hex keys

## [ScroogeCoin](https://github.com/tfrank0651/scroogecoin)
A project where I wrote the transaction handler for the fictional cryptocurrency ScroogeCoin.
