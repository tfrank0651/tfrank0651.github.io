<p align="center"><b>Determining the Role of the Hacking Community in the Future</b></p>

<b>BLUF:</b> The biggest threat to national security is a hacker community motivated by shifting power dynamics between individuals and nation states, hyper partisanship, and a generation of hackers struggling with the morality of contributing to the efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

Over the past decade, there has been a marked increase in the amount of technology used in US citizen's daily lives. Covid-19 has further increased the reliance on technology. To quote Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella "We have seen two years' worth of digital transformation in two months" [9]. Furthermore, hyper-partisanship dominates today's political realm. According to the Pew Research Center: "Partisanship continues to be the dividing line in the American public's political attitudes, far surpassing differences by age, race and ethnicity, gender, educational attainment, religious affiliation or other factors" [11]. The Pew Research Center found that 73% of Americans believe that major corporations have too much power (78% Democrats/lean Democrat and 62% Republican/lean Republican) [11]. It should be noted that US adults were surveyed, not specifically members of the hacker community and their views may differ. However, considering the hacker community's tenuous history with major corporations such as Microsoft combined with recent events, there may be significant carryover between the two groups. 

<b>Hacktivism Against Corporations.</b> The hacker community has always had a subset that was against major corporations, for example the history between Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) and Microsoft and the Back Orifice and BO2k programs [7]. There are the beginnings of a resurgence of hacktivism, which can be seen with both the recent Epik and Twitch hacks. The Epik hack contained over 150Gb of private data that contained usernames, passwords, and other identifying information. While this was a boon for those researching the far right and the events of Jan 6, other US citizens have been caught up in the crossfire. In contrast to the Epik hack, the Twitch hack was motivated by "company efforts to confront harassment and said the site had become a 'disgusting cesspool' [2]." Again, users and US citizens have had their personal information exposed, potentially for use by organized crime or nation states. The success of these attacks, combined with the media reporting on 'hacktivism' may result in an increase of these types of attacks.

<b>Hacktivism Against the Military.</b> Technology continues to grow within the military, both for personal and military use. Smartphone apps have revealed US military personnel bases and activity in both Syria and Iraq [6, 13]. The two largest corporations involved in the Cloud services are Microsoft and Amazon [1]. Both corporations have a large impact on US national security. Amazon has a $10 billion deal with the NSA [4], and Microsoft is deeply involved with the DoD from prototype mixed reality headsets for the Army, the Joint All Domain Command and Control, scaling the USAF IT modernization, and the USN's enhanced weather model [8]. This combination of traditional hacker anti-authoritarian and increasing anti-corporate could lead to a fraction of the hacker community breaking off to pursue a moral crusade against ‘unjust’ corporations without regard to those that provide significant value to US national security. 

<b>Possible Roles for Hackers in the Military/IC.</b> Technology use within the military also has grown and these avenues may provide a unique vector for the hacker community to support the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community (IC). The United States Marine Corps is looking at incorporating small drones into their infantry units [5]. Some of the uses of these drones include gathering real-time imagery, jamming capabilities, and distraction. Another example of hacking crossing into the military domain is the hacking of Correction-D30, an android app used to reduce the time to process artillery data that was used by Ukrainian forces. Russian hackers were able to infect this app and may have gained a tactical advantage during the invasion of Crimea [12]. It is possible that apps such as Correction-D30 may be vulnerable to certain types of cyberattacks that may be conducted from the USMC drones.

<b>The Rise of Political Targets.</b> The Muller Report showed that Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange wanted to influence the 2016 presidential election to attempt to change the political course of the US and was willing to work with Russian hackers for this cause [10]. Additionally, Microsoft’s 2020 Digital Defense Report noted an increase in political targets. The targets included US presidential candidates, current and former officials, and journalists covering them [9]. It is possible that domestic hackers may follow in Russia’s footsteps and start targeting elections to pursue the election of candidates that are aligned with their 'moral crusades' and that conflict with the strategic interests of the US. Also, politicians or their campaigns may try to wield the hacking community as a weapon in the pursuit of their own self interests. Then presidential candidate Donald Trump publicly called on Russian hackers to try to find 30,000 ‘missing’ emails on his political rival Hillary Clinton, resulting in an attack against the DNC [10]. Further attacks on elections will continue to erode public faith in elections and potentially increase the risk of domestic unrest.

<b>Balance of Power.</b> Kilger suggests that the balance of power has shifted with the rise of technology, with an era where an individual may successfully carryout an attack on a nation-state due to changing environmental factors. The two most important factors are: low cost of developing and deploying attacks and the potential for orders of magnitude increase in potential damage over more traditional forms of terrorism [14]. Furthermore, Kilger proposed a four-stage relationship between individuals and nation-states ending in the eventual dissolution of the relationship with the non-nation state actors potentially breaking off to form cyber terror groups [15]. The first generation of hackers working for the US came after the 9/11 attacks, where hackers found fulfillment in government service and contributed to efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq [7 p. 116], as well as finding zero-day exploits for use within the IC [7 p. 119]. This combination of Nationalism and Patriotism falls under Kilger's Stage 2. Stage 3 is the maintenance of the relationship where ongoing grooming of high-status individuals within the groups occurs [15], possibly from hacker conferences such as DefCon. Stage 4 includes replacement by more skilled actors and non-state actors terminating the relationship [15]. Not all members of the hacker community that served the government had positive experiences, such as a member of the cDc Ninja Strike Force Stevens [7 p. 117]. It is possible that members of the hacker community, such as Stevens, may be the beginnings of a domestic cyber threat. This threat will continue to grow as the first generation of hackers that is disillusioned by the work they did for the government, is replaced by a younger generation, allowing them to focus on their own moral crusades.

In conclusion, increasing political division, a bipartisan majority against major corporations- including those providing significant value to US national security, increasing numbers of political targets, and a shift in the power dynamic between individuals and nation states may result in a large resurgence of hacktivism under the banner of moral crusades that will have a significant impact on US national security. Additionally, the ever-growing use of technology within the military poses both a threat to national security and an opportunity for the DoD and IC to utilize hackers in hybrid warfare.
