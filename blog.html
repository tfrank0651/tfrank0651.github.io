  <h3>Notes on the blog...</h3>
  <p>
    This section was originally intended to be the "main" feature of this site, however, work and life happened and I was unable to create something that I felt "worth while". That being said, I do intend to continue to write here - just know that it may not necessarily all be technical documentation, this is just a blog after all.
